 * shall be made to the fgetc() function and the results stored, in
 * the order read, in an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying
 * the object. The file position indicator for the stream (if defined)
 * shall be advanced by the number of bytes successfully read. If an
 * error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator
 * for the stream is unspecified. If a partial element is read, its

 *         of elements successfully read which is less than nitems only
 *         if a read error or end-of-file is encountered. If size or

 * or setvbuf() function shall be disassociated from the stream. If the associated
